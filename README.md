## 🔭 About me

I am a Bachelor of Engineering student in Computer Science (CSE) who loves building practical applications that mix **AR**, **Machine Learning**, and **Web** technologies. I focus on creating accessible, real-world projects — from assistive AR apps to computer vision systems.

* 🎓 BE — Computer Science & Engineering
* 💡 Projects: AR Sign Language Tutor, AR Memory Game for Alzheimer’s patients, Garbage Classification using CV, Smart Hospital Management System
* 🧠 Areas: Computer Vision · AR / WebAR · Machine Learning · Full‑stack Development
* ⚡ Fun fact: I made a short film titled **BROTHERHOOD** — filmmaking fuels my creative problem solving.
